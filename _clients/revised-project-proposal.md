#### The Problem

**Curators have no way to know if visitors are frustrated or confused by exhibits, or if these exhibits started interesting conversations. They are afraid that visitors are leaving WCMA without having their questions answered. Furthermore, curators don't know how people react to exhibits or pieces of artwork.**  

#### Our Approach
We have decided to try and use the responses people have to artwork in order to add depth to museum data. We want to show the "texture and personality" of a collection, and **the responses people have to exhibits. We are operating on the assumption that we have all the necessary data for this project.** 

The base for this project is Landon's [emotional responses to art project proposal](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/CS376/CSCI376/project-proposal/). Our product development is inspired by a combination of Kenneth's [idea of categorizing art by keywords](https://kennethan12.github.io/project/project-proposal/), Chris's [guided tour](https://cla1.github.io/2018-09-21-project-proposal/) concept, and our desire to connect people with artwork that resonates with them. 
 
* First, **we will use this (assumed already collected) data to help curators understand visitor interactions with the museum.**
* Second, **we want to connect curators with visitors in real-time.**

Our vision is to **create an application that will organize and present user data. We want to allow curators to understand the experiences of visitors. Furthermore, we want to repurpose some of those data visualizations. We think it would be cool to have interactive wall panels of anonymized data for visitors to play with.**
