####problem and solution overview

Curators have no way to know if visitors are frustrated or confused by exhibits, or if these exhibits started interesting conversations. They are afraid that visitors are leaving WCMA without having their questions answered. Furthermore, curators don't know how people react to exhibits or pieces of artwork. We have decided to try and use the responses people have to artwork in order to add depth to museum data. We want to show the "texture and personality" of a collection, and the responses people have to exhibits. We are operating on the assumption that we have all the necessary data for this project. **This assumption allows us to first help curators understand and improve visitor interactions with the museum. Secondly, we can visualize the data in ways that allow visitors to view and engage with it as well. POTENTIALLY DELETE**
Our vision is to create an application that will organize and present user data. We want to allow curators to understand the experiences of visitors. Furthermore, we want to repurpose some of those data visualizations. We think it would be cool to have interactive wall panels of anonymized data for visitors to play with.

#### design research goals, stakeholders, and participants

We used a blend of contexual inquiry and interviews to engage with participants. These happened at WCMA. U3 wanted to start in a side gallery before going to the Object Lab, and U4 went directly to the Object Lab. Curator encounters were in offices and archives. Our inquiries analyzed WCMA curators and two Williams students, one who was a summer intern at WCMA and another who is an art enthusiast. The full writeup for each encounter can be found [here](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/groundwork/research/2018/10/04/CI-writeups/) 
From these, we developed a better understanding of both visitor and curator desires for the museum. In particular, the Williams students seemed to want a deeper experience where they can work to understand the art, and possibly even discuss it with others. Curators, on the other hand, want to get better and more direct feedback from the visitors. This is especially useful if they can get a sense of what frustrates people, and which galleries people are most interested in. We asked students what they thought of a low-tech data collection solution, and they liked the idea of post-it walls between exhibits. When asked for their thoughts on solutions for more engaging exhibits, students had varying thoughts on what made a good exhibit. One didn't like the arrangement of art, while the other student enjoyed having to engage with art and question. The curators didn't want a way to track emotion, since it is so subjective. Instead, they want some way to hear what is frustrating or interesting to visitors. 

#### design research and themes

Our high level themes are now feedback and engagement. Visitors expressed a desire to understand, relate to, and engage with exhibits, but without having answers handed to them. Meanwhile, curators wanted to create exhibits for people to critically engage with, wanted immediate feedback on exhibits, and wanted to give context. 

We identified themes by looking for common statements, concerns, and questions between our participants, as well as their differences. The curators and visitors had opposing responses despite shared priorities. However, all of them -- and the disconnect between responses -- point to an issue of curator/visitor communication. 

We are assuming that the data we need has already been collected. This allows us to focus on the challenge of organzing and representing data. We have decided to focus almost entirely on curators, which will allow us to simplify our design.  We currently plan on building an app that organizes and communicates that data efficiently to the curators (e.g. maybe has a mix of visitor comments, number of people visiting exhibit, number of people who liked a certain artwork, etc.). Since the visualization and data work has already happened, we intend to repurpose it in order to engage visitors (and possibly create a more direct connection between visitors and curators). We are considering the merits of  an interactive wall panel that displays select data, and allows visitors to interact with it in some way or another (e.g. touch a pink bubble that splinters into different pieces of information about certain exhibits). 

We also want to further explore the idea of immediate feedback via text, whether texts are sent to a curator or AI. This system could use a piece, exhibit, or theme-specific key word so that responses were sent to the right individual or team. This is inspired by the curator's comment that "he wished he could get visitor questions directly sent to his phone so he could answer them (given he had the time), that way it might eliminate some frustration." 

#### task analysis 

We intend the majority of this design to be used by curators. We plan on repurposing some of the work in order to engage with museum visitors. Our tasks allow curators to view and respond to feedback from visitors based on date/time, theme, or exhibit in question. They also will allow visitors to engage with select portions of this data in an interactive exhibit, modeled after the data visualizations curators have access to. Hopefully, our tasks will help curators develop exhibits based on understanding visitor experiences, and increase visitor willingness to give feedback. The ability to perform curation tasks is  developed through formal education, personal style development, and mentorship, and assisted by the presence of interns, professional peers, and the museum database. Our design will allow curators to deepen their skills and work more effectively as they go through the WCMA archives. Curators need access to precise, yet diverse, data. They need visitor experience, quantified. Right now they have a gap in data because many people who don't take the WCMA experience surveys or exit interviews. We are assuming this data has been provided -- it is now our responsibility to help make sense of it. Curators are currently designing new exhibits 2-3 times a year, so we are focusing on the real-time reporting of data to curators, with features that allow them to examine feedback over different timespans. If things go wrong, curators will be making decisions based on faulty information since our design is focused on data organization and visualization. 

#### design sketches 
(1 paragraph) Present scanned images of your three initial designs in the context of their four tasks. Include one paragraph for each design, discussing how it supports your tasks. Include one paragraph discussing your choice of design and tasks to further pursue. Include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions and refer to the figures in the body of your text



#### written scenario 
 (1 paragraph) Convert your two tasks into written scenarios for your design. Scenarios include the steps a person will go through to accomplish the task, including references to your design. Scenarios do not need to detail every little step, but should be realistic, should be dependent upon the design you have chosen, should appropriately reference elements of your design, and should communicate how a person will accomplish the task using your design. Include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions and refer to the figures in the body of your text


#### storyboards of selected design
Include updated storyboards of your design. Reference these appropriately in your scenarios. Include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions and refer to the figures in the body of your text
