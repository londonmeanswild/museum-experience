general idea:
Visitors come into museum and either pick up some device or sign into an app. As they walk around they can give feedback on certain pieces of art (task 2). This feedback will be saved to the database for each specific piece they comment on (task 3). Some computer algorithm (probably not important how it would be implemented) would search for certain keywords in each of the comments. It would then categorize these comments based on positive/negative feedback, whether or not the feedback is a question, etc. (task 5). This information would then be sent to curators.

2: combine tasks 3, 4, 5, 6

general idea:
Let’s assume we have all of the data we need. Maybe we create some sort of application that summarizes the data and makes it easy for curators to find what they’re looking for. Our application’s interface would be something like a bunch bar charts or histograms that shows how many people looked at a certain piece, how many people commented on it (maybe can click a button and it then shows you the comments). Could have the information grouped by exhibit so it’s easy for curators to know which exhibits provoke certain emotions. Also, could allow curators to reply to visitors’ comments. That way curators will have a more direct connection to visitor and can create discussions about artworks.

3: combine tasks 2, 3, 4, 5 


general idea: 
create an app that essentially allows curators to virtually test exhibits. Instead of having temporary exhibits where visitors provide feedback, curators will create a virtual temporary exhibit that visitors can walk through on the app. Similarly to how the museum has promotions for temporary exhibits, they can do something to try to promote the exploration of these virtual exhibits. Even though it might be difficult to get a representative sample of visitors, this will allow much faster feedback (task 2). Additionally, since the feedback will already be submitted electronically, summarizing it will be a lot easier (can do the same thing where you tag certain keywords in the feedback — task 5), and the data will already be assigned to each piece of artwork (task 3). Finally, this will make it easier for curators to curate exhibits (task 4) since they can test things more easily and see how they work.
