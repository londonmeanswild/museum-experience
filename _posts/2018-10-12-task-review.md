Summarize and Communicate Visitor Feedback to Curators - Easy, Existing

Antonio is a WCMA curator who manages the Dance We Must exhibit. It has been awhile since many of the pieces in that exhibit have been changed, so he decides that it’s time to swap out some of the displayed artwork with some of the ones that have been in storage for awhile. Furthermore, there was recently an exhibition that had a large proportion of visitors give their feedback about the artwork. Antonio wants to incorporate some of this visitor feedback as he chooses pieces to retrieve out of storage, but he soon realizes that it will take him hours to read and organize all of this information. Additionally, a significant number of visitors talk about things like the weather being too cold, which is currently unhelpful information for Antonio. He wishes there were a better and more efficient way to go through this feedback, so he can get back to finding pieces from storage that he wants to display. 


Establish a Direct Connection Between Curators and Visitors (i.e. where visitors can ask clarifying questions) - Medium/Difficult, New

Odell is a WCMA curator who has been walking around the museum to get a better sense of how visitors are enjoying the exhibits. However, as he is walking around, he sees a man and his wife who are debating about the meaning of a painting. They go back and forth, arguing about the artist’s intention, but get nowhere with the conversation. They both realize that neither of them know enough history about the artist to accurately determine who is right. In an attempt to learn a little more about this artist, they start frantically walking around and asking WCMA staff if they knew any more information. After Odell catches up to the couple, he is able to talk to them and explain more about the piece, making the couple happy. They soon walk out of the museum with smiles on their faces as they feel this museum visit was an enlightening experience. Odell realizes that this couple can’t be the only visitors who have frustrations like this. He wishes there were some way where visitors could contact him quickly if they had immediate questions. This way, if he happened to have some free time, he might be able to explain some things that give the visitors a better and more enlightening experience.
