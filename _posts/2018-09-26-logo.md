### Presenting the best logo

We wanted to create a logo that best represents the importance of human connection to art: the fact that art itself is made from human emotions, and it delivers human emotions to the audience. Our data contains the emotional response of a person looking at the art -- what the art made the person feel, and therefore, what the art made the person think or do. The logo shows a heart made out of art, of different colors, to show that any art can cause an emotional response.
