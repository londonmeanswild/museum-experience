Notes from UT2

Exhibit A: 
Is this a representation of an exhibit or icons.
See more drops the menu down
I tend to not like thumbnails so I click on the art to take a closer look

What is data vis?
Stick with arrows 


data analytics graphs links to the comments 
Interesting thing given WCMA’s general mission is the educational value, so add 
Museums > schools in objective educational value 
Types of exhibitions people would like to see, or how some of them could be improved 
African art against the space: is there an equitable balance of nationalities and traditions in this space or would you prefer a wider diversity
Assume you have perfect/ideal data: 
The best approach might be to incorporate a little bit of flexibility. Amazon review organization style in bar chart for “feedback” and bar takes you back to the feedback page.

Educational value: sampling of individuals who felt it had enormous/little educational value 

All feedback screen wasn’t clearly feedback, thought it was a conversation chain.
Make note to add timestamp to comments 
Tag comments relating to certain types? 
Sorting feedback in terms of time, and I don’t know if date would work 

Thinking about your graphs, if I was a curator relying on visitor feedback, a lot of things I care about would relate to diversity of objects, educational value, interest of narrative, if you’re looking to streamline that might not be the best way - but how do we add the subtlety? 

Lay out all feedback like Questions and Suggestions 
What is [text preview]?  Had to explain that. 
Can we include to whom the Q/S is directed? Curator, director, educational programming department? Parse the question/suggestion by topic?

- Note to maybe add a help feature on the home screen. To distinguish between things we can reply to and things we can’t. 
- Allow for [event and programming] feedback 

Went back. Didn’t see the reply/text page
Home
Can we divide responses between exhibition/programming? Nest programming within exhibit. 

Allow curators to generate their own graphs based on data. Different types of visualization they can work with. 
Generating cross-variables. One of the biggest problems with WCMA site and searching: we have discrete categories. China, Africa, Photographs, Paper. What if you have an African photograph? There is no dynamic access. It’s a value judgement by the categorizer. 

Didn’t know I could click on reply 
Liked the communicate page. Said it makes a lot more sense. 
Assumption is that the curator can respond to the suggestion. 
- In terms of individual asking the question. Are they aware that the curator has the power to ignore their question? Some people might take that personally.
- One thing you could do, it provides a forum, can get their contact info from them so if a  curator decides to respond they have the responsibility - rather than setting up a system that sets the expectation. Like WCMA website 
- If you press ignore button, does that mark the response as ignored? Does it change your color? 
    - Originally we had thought the question/comment would disappear
    - need some kind of archive: grey text, and red ignore instead of green replied
    - Do we want to give curator way to take notes on responses?  Your notes function. Make note button on the reply to page? Moves to your notes and fills in t he piece of art, etc. 
    - Beyond responding is there a fx that allows a curator to forward information to other people. Out of the app? Share the data/ graph you build with someone? 
        - Take screenshot or share 
Current exhibit analytics: what would you think bout creating part of screen that. Said “future exhibition planning” 
- Have current and past, but create interface to allow curator to potentially plan in anticipation. tools they can create initial layouts and collect. Work for inclusion along with information about them, exhibitions they’ve been used n the past + feedback. 
    - Add future exhibitions
