Notes from UT2

Exhibit A: 
Is this a representation of an exhibit or icons.
See more drops the menu down
I tend to not like thumbnails so I click on the art to take a closer look

What is data vis?
Stick with arrows 


data analytics graphs links to the comments 
Interesting thing given WCMA’s general mission is the educational value, so add 
Museums > schools in objective educational value 
Types of exhibitions people would like to see, or how some of them could be improved 
African art against the space: is there an equitable balance of nationalities and traditions in this space or would you prefer a wider diversity
Assume you have perfect/ideal data: 
The best approach might be to incorporate a little bit of flexibility. Amazon review organization style in bar chart for “feedback” and bar takes you back to the feedback page.

Educational value: sampling of individuals who felt it had enormous/little educational value 

All feedback screen wasn’t clearly feedback, thought it was a conversation chain.
Make note to add timestamp to comments 
Tag comments relating to certain types? 
Sorting feedback in terms of time, and I don’t know if date would work 

Thinking about your graphs, if I was a curator relying on visitor feedback, a lot of things I care about would relate to diversity of objects, educational value, interest of narrative, if you’re looking to streamline that might not be the best way - but how do we add the subtlety? 

Lay out all feedback like Questions and Suggestions 
What is [text preview]?  Had to explain that. 
Can we include to whom the Q/S is directed? Curator, director, educational programming department? Parse the question/suggestion by topic?

- Note to maybe add a help feature on the home screen. To distinguish between things we can reply to and things we can’t. 
- Allow for [event and programming] feedback 

Went back. Didn’t see the reply/text page
Home
Can we divide responses between exhibition/programming? Nest programming within exhibit. 

Allow curators to generate their own graphs based on data. Different types of visualization they can work with. 
Generating cross-variables. One of the biggest problems with WCMA site and searching: we have discrete categories. China, Africa, Photographs, Paper. What if you have an African photograph? There is no dynamic access. It’s a value judgement by the categorizer. 

Didn’t know I could click on reply 
Liked the communicate page. Said it makes a lot more sense. 
Assumption is that the curator can respond to the suggestion. 
- In terms of individual asking the question. Are they aware that the curator has the power to ignore their question? Some people might take that personally.
- One thing you could do, it provides a forum, can get their contact info from them so if a  curator decides to respond they have the responsibility - rather than setting up a system that sets the expectation. Like WCMA website 
- If you press ignore button, does that mark the response as ignored? Does it change your color? 
    - Originally we had thought the question/comment would disappear
    - need some kind of archive: grey text, and red ignore instead of green replied
    - Do we want to give curator way to take notes on responses?  Your notes function. Make note button on the reply to page? Moves to your notes and fills in t he piece of art, etc. 
    - Beyond responding is there a fx that allows a curator to forward information to other people. Out of the app? Share the data/ graph you build with someone? 
        - Take screenshot or share 
Current exhibit analytics: what would you think bout creating part of screen that. Said “future exhibition planning” 
- Have current and past, but create interface to allow curator to potentially plan in anticipation. tools they can create initial layouts and collect. Work for inclusion along with information about them, exhibitions they’ve been used n the past + feedback. 
    - Add future exhibitions 
    
   
   Notes from UT3
   Curator 

Home screen: asked what each thing is. said it would help to have indicators of what each exhibit is. 
Q&S screen: identified text preview and exhibit, then asked how to sort. 
	Sort dropdown
- curators like visual things, prettier and visual, less text the better. 
- Match symbols of reply and replied and ignored on the dropdown and this screen. 
- chris asked how we should organize. 
    - Questions are different from comments. Those are different, so separate questions and suggestions.  I would feel compelled to answer questions, suggestions I’d want to tuck away. I’d want to address people’s questions in a more timely way. 

Clicked reply button
Identified components of the screen, clicked respond. Said our keyboard pop up was cute. 
- Is there some limit to how much you can write? (Chris: At this point we’re thinking limits based on time)
Clicked Ignore:
Explained GMAIL functionality and meaning of ignore. Said it seems g ood.

Home screen.  All feedback. 
- We collect visitor comments in a more manual way via people taking surveys and. Interviews, so monthly we get the responses. 
- Didn’t jump to “narrow feedback.” Chris asked: what information would be most useful to you? Would you prefer more subsets in home, or more robust sort features? 
    - Would prefer the categories in the home page. All feedback seems overwhelming. Why would I ever want to see that? That wouldn’t be a daily occurrence, that could be buried. Can we break it down by time? What’s the stuff that’s most useful to me? A: q questions people have for me. If people have questions about the art or show itself then I didn’t convey something right. B: suggestions about what I can do better or differently may or may not be useful depending on the source. I think we wanna know, we want to have as good of a sense we can if the goals of the show, the goals we’ve set are being met, if they’re coming away with XYZ and not coming away with that we want to know. or I they are coming away with that and something else, that’s useful. The comments are to help me understand if I’ve met my goals FOR THE exhibition. The tricky part about when you open up to visitors response is you. Often get suggestions for show to. That may or may not be useful. 
- Chris “for you personally, what data would you like?” 
    - Splitting up by exhibit, questions, then suggestions.  
    - The issue is. not knowing anything about the person. If. The. Host is asking in person they’ll know if there’s an accessibility problem that prevents. The visitor from enjoying t he exhibit. Context. Is significant but I don’t see how you can capture that. Context is important. Is there a way for feedback givers to identify that gives them some context and relationship to the museum.  That way we can see feedback from students or something, and visualize it. That might inform decision we might make. 
    - Institutionally we’d want to see the questions overall so we could see seasonal responses.

home. Exhibit E. 
“Oh boy okay.” Seemed overwhelmed. 
Thumbnails need to be sorted by comments and feedback.
Graphs: things that are new to collection wouldn’t be connect to specific artwork. 

Chris asked what set of data would be useful to visualize:
- Overall satisfaction with experience is useful. 
- I think I want to know if. They’re taking away what I think I’m putting out. If I’m making a show, writing labels, putting it on the wall, are they coming away from the experience with the things I hope they do. Is their experience the one I was hoping I would have? The kinds of things I would want to know are. 
    - overall sense of what the show is doing
    - Big takeaway, big thought about the exhibition
    - Did something in particular move them in one way or another? Tell them something they didn’t know, help them see something in a new way. Piss them off? Make them think? 
        - But it would be again somewhat contextual scaled to. The kinds of goals I can set. But can the ways we collect data be tailored to the goals we have set? So we’re asking the right question in the right way. 
- I like the art thumbnails but I think the majority of feedback will be about a general experience. It’ll be less art-object specific. 

We’re always j just struggling with knowing who our public is, who they are, we have some vague antidotal ways to know that but. We don’t always really know who they are.  And. That should inform a lot of what we’re doing. Not that we should do things to please the public but the more we know about who they are the more we can develop and be intentional about what we’re trying to do and how we’re trying to engage. 

Make sure that the assumption of our information is clearly conveyed and the assumptions we are
