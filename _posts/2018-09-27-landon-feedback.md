#### Problem and Motivation

* Visualizing qualitative data about the visitor experience is an interesting avenue of inquiry. I encourage you to focus more on this - what are other ways we can capture this qualitative data? Why might we want to do so? What tasks/goals does it accomplish?

#### Analysis of Problem

* Probably should've weighted a little more text to the problem, and less to the solution. User research will give more guidance on what the design solution will be. It is very difficult to come up with solutions until you understand the problem!

#### Report Clarity and Presentation

* For future presentations, you/your-team might want to consider structures for an elevator pitch. Here's one for research ([but works well for the UX research in this class)](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1779/what-are-the-elements-of-an-effective-elevator-pitch) to an external site.
  * What is the basic problem?
  * Why is solving this problem important?
  * How are you solving this problem in an original (conversely, well-though-out) way?
  
  #### Novelty and Creativity
* When brainstorming with your team, be sure to start with coming up with *a lot* of ideas, even bad ones. Find the good pieces in the individual idea and combine them into an interesting problem as a team.
