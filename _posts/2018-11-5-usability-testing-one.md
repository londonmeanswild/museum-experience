title:  usability testing check-in
---

We conducted a cognitive walk-through as a team, and the changes we made were in relation to tasks performed. We decided to be more specific about the tasks we presented to people in order to help them navigate the paper prototype. 

### first usability test

Our first usability test was with a student. UT1 is an econ major who has only been to WCMA once, but asks a lot of questions about the way things work. UT1 is a good friend of Malibu's so she didn't attend this test. We met at Lee's because UT1 was finishing up dinner and had a short window of time in which to do the test. Each team member introduced themselves, and explained their roles. Landon introduced the project and took notes while Chris was the computer and performed the majority of in-test communication. Kenneth was going to take notes but had to leave unexpectedly. UT1 knows one of our classmates, so we found out mid-introduction that they had already heard about the project and assignment. Landon introduced the project as an application that will allow WCMA curators to interact with visitor feedback and exhibit data.  

We found this exercise to be most helpful as a design review rather than a testing protocol review. While UT1 performed actions and talked through their thoughts, we identified aspects of the design that made navigation difficult. Some of the critiques were of things that had been recommended by technically trained testers, which is interesting. As the testing process unfolded we realized we needed to be prepared for users to take different paths to the same information. 


#### cognitive walk-through results
Our cognitive walk-through proved to be relatively unexciting because our hueristic evaluators were quite attentive to issues. A lot of their feedback fixed problems that otherwise would have come up in the walkthrough. We also may be too close to the project, because we weren't able to come up with issues as we walked through the app. It may have been useful to do a cognitive walkthrough with an outside perspective.

|       Incident Descirption        | Severity (if negative) |      Image and Explanation of Revision |         
|:---------------------------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|:
|   Confusion about sort/narrow     |            2            |    See image (number).  Solution is to only have the "narrow" drop-down menu, with an up-down arrow next to it to indicate sorting.    |
|   Add "reply" button to questions and suggestions in "all feedback"     |   3       |   Add "reply" button to questions or suggestions that come up under "all feedback." This takes users to the communication screens. |    
|   Swipe through data viz on EXHIBIT [  ] screen     |      1                  |  Add left and right arrow to indicate swiping ability.  |    

### images

*Submit detailed images of your current paper prototype, as revised in this process. Include both:
An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.*
